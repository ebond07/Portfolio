            My adventure into the world of computers began in my first year of high school as I took on a specialized program, dedicating 2 hours every day to learning various aspects within the computer science field.
            This continued into college as I took on the challenge of pursuing a DEC in computer science. It took nothing short of hard work, dedication, and many many of my hours to complete the program while earning myself a spot on the Deanâ€™s List every semester.
