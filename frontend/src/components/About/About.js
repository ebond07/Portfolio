            Hello! My name is <strong>Evan Bond</strong>. I'm from Montreal, Canada and have lived there my entire life.
            Throughout my life, I have gained valuable experience through jobs in various fields. These not only increased my knowledge of computers but also gave way to some of the things I am most proud of; my adaptability, my work ethic, as well as my dedication to improving myself every day.

            My adventure into the world of computers began in my first year of high school as I took on a specialized program, dedicating 2 hours every day to learning various aspects within the computer science field.
            This continued into college as I took on the challenge of pursuing a DEC in computer science. It took nothing short of hard work, dedication, and many many of my hours to complete the program while earning myself a spot on the Deanâ€™s List every semester.

              Working within teams throughout my time in college was an incredibly valuable and eye-opening experience that has fueled my eagerness to continue exploring exciting projects in the future, with a particular interest in web development and full-stack applications.
